# MVP Goals
[] generate SDF from triangle meshes
[] convert triangle mesh to tetrahedral mesh
[] compute and export quality measures of the tetrahedral mesh

# API work
[] - Add the converter app that transforms a surface mesh to SDF and extracts a volume mesh from the SDF
[] - tetmesh add all samples as unit-tests
[] - Add hexmesh
[] - export to JSON
[] - Python interface

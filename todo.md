# MVP Goals
[] generate SDF from triangle meshes
[] convert triangle mesh to tetrahedral mesh
[] compute and export quality measures of the tetrahedral mesh

# API work
[] - Add the converter app that transforms a surface mesh to SDF and extracts a volume mesh from the SDF
[] - tetmesh add all samples as unit-tests
[] - Add hexmesh
[] - export to JSON
[] - Python interface
[] - documentation and sample images

[x] - tetmesh writeToList
[x] - Half-Edge data structure
[x] - top-down traversal
[x] - bottom-top traversal
[x] - Add unit-tests

# History

## 4/14/2024
- Need to add per vertex pseudo normals for SDF computations
- Voxel grid setup and compute distance values

# MVP Goals
1- export and visualize sample models in paraview
2- convert simple 3D surface meshes to tetrahedra meshes
3- compute and export quality measures of the tetrahedral meshes

# current work 02/28/2024
- finish triangle mesh class to access edges and faces
- read the STL and build the database of entities

# last updated on 02/04/2024
[] - Add the converter app that transforms a surface mesh to SDF and extracts a volume mesh from the SDF
[] - tetmesh add all samples as unit-tests
[] - Add hexmesh
[] - export to JSON
[] - Python interface
[] - documentation and sample images

[x] - tetmesh writeToList
[x] - Half-Edge data structure
[x] - top-down traversal
[x] - bottom-top traversal
[x] - Add unit-tests
